## Annotations

- Begin with the @ symbol.
- They provide metadata to the compiler or JVM. They can be used on classes, methods, interfaces or other constructs. They are often used by libraries that provide additional functionality.
- Java has a few built in annotations:
    - @Override: declares a method must override a parentâ€™s method.
    - @Deprecated (method is obsolete) @SupressWarnings (instructs the compiler to suppress any compilation warns such as those generated by @Deprecated) @FunctionalInterface (designates a functional interface for use with lambda expressions)
