## Wrapper Class
- let you treat primitives as objects
    - int: Integer
    - boolean: Boolean
    - char: Character
- nessary for using primitives in your collections or maybe you have some method that only takes objects

### Boxing
- converting primitives into a wrapper class variants
- Java's autoboxing feature does this for us(implicity)
- Java's auto-unboxing feature does the opposite
