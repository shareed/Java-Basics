# Methods
## [Method Overloading](../Methods/Overloading.java)
**At times we may want the same type of functionality of one method but use it for different inputs. If we have to perform only one operation, having same name of the methods increases the readability of the program**
- creating more than one method with the same name but differnt number and/or types of parameters and/or order of parameters
- helps us create components that are easy to use and easy to remember
- the parameter list has to be different
- can throw Exceptions
- can return a different datatype

## Method Overriding
- a child class can override a method inherited from its parent, but you must define a method in the child class with the same signature as its parent; in general, it should have the same name, number and type of parameters
