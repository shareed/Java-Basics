# Four major principles of Object-Oriented development
_____________
## Inheritance
- gives access to the states and behaviors of one class to another similar to how a child
- the parent class is also referred to as the **base or super class** 
- the child class is also referred to as the subclass or derived class.
- a class can extend only one class; it may have only one direct parent class.
- multiple inheritance is when one class has more than one direct parent class. Java does not support multiple inheritance.
- inheritance is an **IS-A** relationship. A child class is considered as a parent class.
- inheritance supports polymorphism, an object is considered an instance of every class in its inheritance chain
