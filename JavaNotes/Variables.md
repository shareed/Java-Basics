# Variables
- reserved memory locations to store values

## Data Type of a variable
- datatypes are assigned to variables
- the operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory(variable), based on the data type
- There are two data types available in Java:
    - **Primitive Data Types:**
        - predefined by Java and named by a keyword
        - Java supports the folowing eight primitive data types:
            - **byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char**
    - **Reference Data Types:**
        - variables that are created using defined constructors of the classes
        - used to access objects
        - declared to be of a specific type that cannot be changed
        - include class objects, and various type of array variables
        - default value is null
        - can be used to refer to any object of the declared type or any compatible type
        - Example: Animal animal = new Animal("giraffe");
        - Class objects, and various type of array variables come under reference data type.
        - Default value of any reference variable is null.
        - A reference variable can be used to refer to any object of the declared type or any compatible type.
        - Example: Animal animal = new Animal("giraffe");
